## What is Learningate?
Learningate is a cloudbased learning app targetted towards younger children, with the goal of gamifying learning to provide a more engaging learning experience. This helps to provide the children to absorb knowledge more efficiently.

This idea was born from the need on helping children to maintain a sustainable and engaging learning process, particularly in the face of challenges such as shorter attention spans, limited access to traditional educational resources, and the shift to online education. By incorporating elements of gamification, Learningate can foster a fun and interactive environment where children are motivated to learn through rewards, progress tracking, and engaging challenges.
